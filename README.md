Beginning operation in August 2013 as Bay Area Bike Share, the Ford GoBike system currently has over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. On June 28, 2017, the system officially launched as Ford GoBike in a partnership with Ford Motor Company.

>Similar to other bike share systems, Ford GoBike consists of a fleet of bikes that can be unlocked in one station and returned in any other network station. Thus, this is ideal for one-way trips. These bikes are available for use thorughout the year and riders have access to all bikes in the network. The bikes are available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year and riders have access to all bikes in the network when they become a member or purchase a pass.


## Summary of Findings

> One will think a bike share system will be patronised more by tourists more but the analysis shows that since the rides are rented out most withing the rush hours of getting to work and departure, workers tend to patronise the system most.

>It is quite normal for people within the age group of 25 -35 patronise Ford Bike Share most since they are mostly energic.

>The analysis and visualisations reveal that people irrespective of age, gender prefer to just be customers other than subscribers..
